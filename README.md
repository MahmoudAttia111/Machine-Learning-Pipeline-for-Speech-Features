# Machine Learning Pipeline for Speech Features

## Project Description
This project implements a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for analyzing and classifying speech features. The workflow includes:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning missing values.
   - Handling outliers.
   - Correcting data types.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing key features using plots.
   - Investigating relationships between features and the target variable.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Creating new features based on signal analysis.
   - Selecting the most relevant features using statistical methods.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Comparing multiple machine learning algorithms:
     - Random Forest
     - Gradient Boosting
     - Logistic Regression
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - Naive Bayes, and more.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Assessing model performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
